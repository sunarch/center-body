Center Body
===========

A Firefox Add-on to simply center `<body>` by pushing a toolbar button.

There are some websites that have a left-aligned body of text that can be
uncomfortable to read.
If you haven't encountered any, some examples include homepages / blogs of some
tech people I like to read and archives of mailing lists.
I find it more comfortable to center them, and this add-on makes that process
the push of a button. Maybe someone else gets some use out of it too.

On add-on site: [Center Body](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/center-body/).

### Compatibility

Tested with Firefox 100.0.2 under Ubuntu (Linux).

### Other projects

When looking through the available add-ons I found one that does something similar:
"Center Pages"
([GitHub](https://github.com/feluxe/Center-Pages))
([Add-on page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/center-pages/))
by Felix Meyer-Wolters
([GitHub](https://github.com/feluxe)).
It takes a different value-based approach, that is not exactly what I wanted to do.
This is not an endorsement of that project, simply a mention.
